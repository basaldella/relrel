# RELated entities - RELoaded

This project is the follow-up of the [winning project](https://github.com/basaldella/uncommonfacts) of the [SSSW 2015](http://sssw.org) summer school. Our goal is, given an input Wikipedia page, to find *interesting curiosities* into the page.

## Status

We're currently working to evolve our toy example into a proper research project. Next goals are:

1. Improve the algorithm to get all pages in a category 
2. Include a PageRank algorithm to obtain better results
3. Provide a decent output instead of the current stdout output
4. Build a proper evaluation environment
5. Evaluate the results
